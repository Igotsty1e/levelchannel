# Engineering Backlog

Concrete engineering task queue. This file describes what still needs
to be implemented, not the current actual state of production.

If a task already works in code or on the server, it does not belong
here.

## Lesson learned — 2026-05-07 — close the smoke blind spot

`/api/health` instantiates its own ad-hoc `Pool` (see
`app/api/health/route.ts:44`). It does NOT exercise the shared
`getDbPool()` factory in `lib/db/pool.ts` that production routes
(cabinet, admin, slots, payments) actually use. Wave 1.1's overzealous
"refuse localhost in prod" throw fired only on the shared path; the
health probe came back green from its private pool, so post-deploy
smoke claimed everything was OK while every authenticated route was
500-ing.

Concrete follow-ups (open queue):

- ~~**Health probe should exercise the shared pool too.**~~
  **Closed 2026-05-07.** `app/api/health/route.ts` now calls
  `getDbPool()` and races a `select 1` against a 2 s timeout. A
  future regression in `resolveSslConfig` / env handling fires on
  the health probe and stops the deploy. The 2 s race preserves the
  bounded latency the old ad-hoc Pool got from `connectionTimeoutMillis`.
- **Deploy-time smoke runner.** Add a `scripts/post-deploy-smoke.sh`
  (or a workflow step) that hits 5–8 routes the operator cares about:
  `/api/health`, `/api/auth/me` (anon → expect 401), `/login`,
  `/cabinet` (anon → expect 307), `/admin/login`, `/admin/slots`
  (anon → expect 307), `/checkout/<some-tariff-slug>` (200), and
  asserts each returns the expected status. Fail loudly, don't just
  log. Wired into the autodeploy script so a 500-ing prod doesn't
  ship silently.
- ~~**CI integration tests.**~~
  **Closed 2026-05-07.** `.github/workflows/integration-tests.yml`
  runs `npm run test:integration` on every PR and every push to main.
  The Wave 1 + Wave 2 integration tests (webhook dedup, audit
  encryption, learner-archetype gate) and all auth/payment/scheduling
  integration tests are now blocking — a regression caught by a real-
  Postgres test fails CI before merge.

## Today — 2026-05-07 — after 18:06 UTC

### Re-run Codex adversarial review after usage-cap reset

The first attempt at the Codex adversarial review against PRs #45–#52
hit the per-account daily cap mid-prompt (`/tmp/codex-review.jsonl`
line 4: `You've hit your usage limit. ... try again at 6:06 PM`).
A manual self-review was done in the same session and produced 8
findings, of which fixes #1, #5, #7, #8 will land before this entry
fires (see PRs / commits chained off `ab6ac07`).

After 18:06 UTC re-run codex against the **updated** codebase:

```bash
cat /tmp/codex-review-prompt.md | \
  /Applications/Codex.app/Contents/Resources/codex exec \
    --skip-git-repo-check --json \
    | tee /tmp/codex-review-2.jsonl
```

Compare codex findings against the self-review:

- Anything codex finds that the self-review missed → file as new
  backlog entry, severity-rate, schedule.
- Anything codex confirms the self-review caught → close the loop in
  this backlog entry with a note.
- Anything codex marks as "blocked" that the self-review flagged as
  active → re-examine; one of us is wrong.

This is the loop-closure for "second mind" — the self-review has a
known conflict-of-interest (the same agent that wrote the code is
reviewing it). Codex's independent run is the validation step.

## TOMORROW — 2026-05-08 — verify and execute

### Wave 2.1 Phase B — null out plaintext PII in `payment_audit_events`

**This is the destructive completion of Wave 2.1 (encryption-at-rest).
After 24h+ of real prod traffic on the dual-write path it should be
the first thing checked next morning.**

Wave 2.1 (PR #45 squash `a094337`, shipped 2026-05-07) added
`customer_email_enc` + `client_ip_enc` bytea columns and started
dual-writing them via pgcrypto. The plaintext columns are still
populated for safe rollback during the migration window. Real
security gain (DB-dump leak useless without the key) only kicks in
once plaintext is wiped.

Pre-flight checks (must all pass before running the destructive UPDATE):

- [ ] At least 24 hours have elapsed since the Wave 2.1 deploy.
- [ ] `/api/health` reports the post-Wave SHA + `database: ok`.
- [ ] No `[audit]` warns in `journalctl -u levelchannel` over the last
      24h (an `AUDIT_ENCRYPTION_KEY` mismatch / missing key surfaces
      there).
- [ ] Re-run the verification probe and confirm zero plaintext-only
      rows AND non-zero `_enc` populated rows:

      ```sql
      select
        count(*) filter (where customer_email is not null and customer_email_enc is null) as plaintext_only_email,
        count(*) filter (where client_ip is not null and client_ip_enc is null)         as plaintext_only_ip,
        count(*) filter (where customer_email_enc is not null)                          as encrypted_email_rows,
        count(*) filter (where client_ip_enc is not null)                               as encrypted_ip_rows
      from payment_audit_events;
      ```

      Expect `plaintext_only_*` = 0 and `encrypted_*_rows` ≥ 18 (the
      backfilled count from 2026-05-07; should grow with every new
      audit event since).

- [ ] Sample roundtrip: pick three rows by hand and confirm
      `pgp_sym_decrypt(customer_email_enc, '<key>') = customer_email`.
      If any row mismatches, STOP and investigate before the
      destructive step.

- [ ] Snapshot the table before the destructive UPDATE so a rollback
      is one query away:

      ```sql
      create table payment_audit_events_pre_phase_b as
        select * from payment_audit_events;
      ```

      Drop the snapshot only after Phase B has been in prod for ≥7 days
      with no rollback need.

Destructive step (run inside a transaction, eyes on the dashboard):

```sql
begin;
update payment_audit_events
   set customer_email = null,
       client_ip      = null
 where customer_email_enc is not null
    or client_ip_enc       is not null;
-- expect a row count matching the backfilled set + new rows since.
-- if the count looks wrong, ROLLBACK; do not COMMIT.
commit;
```

Post-flight:

- [ ] `/api/admin/payments/[invoiceId]` still renders audit events
      with `customer_email` populated (reads now exclusively go
      through `pgp_sym_decrypt`).
- [ ] `/api/health` still reports `database: ok`.
- [ ] Write one smoke audit event post-update (e.g. by issuing a
      throwaway `POST /api/payments` on the mock backend) and confirm
      the new row has `customer_email IS NULL` and
      `customer_email_enc IS NOT NULL`.

Phase C (drop the now-empty plaintext columns) goes into a separate
backlog entry **once Phase B has been in prod ≥30 days with no
rollback need**. Do not chain Phase B + Phase C in the same window.

## Wave 3 — security hardening, deferred from 2026-05-07 self-review

Two findings from the self-adversarial review that ARE real but are
medium-effort design work — not safe to chain onto the in-flight
security batch. Schedule for a dedicated wave with planning + tests.

### #3 — webhook handler concurrency (LOW severity, intentional simplification)

**Closed 2026-05-07** in PR #60. `lib/payments/cloudpayments-route.ts:processSerialized` wraps lookup → handler → record on a sticky pool client inside one transaction with `pg_advisory_xact_lock(hashtext("cp:<kind>:<txId>"))`. Concurrent retries serialise: first acquires lock, runs handler, records, commits (lock auto-released); second waits at lock, then post-lock re-check finds the cached row and short-circuits.

Edge case handled: if `recordWebhookDeliveryClient` throws AFTER the handler ran (e.g. Postgres outage mid-INSERT), the path swallows the record error and returns the handler outcome directly — does NOT fall through to the legacy pipeline (which would re-run the handler and duplicate side effects). Pre-handler errors fall through to the legacy non-dedup path.

The handler's own DB writes (`markOrderPaid`, audit, allocation) happen on different pool connections — they're NOT inside the lock-holding transaction. The lock just serialises "who runs the pipeline"; per-op atomicity stays at the data layer.

3 unit tests pin the new pool.connect / BEGIN / advisory lock / COMMIT / release flow. 1 integration test (real Postgres) fires two concurrent `payHandler` requests with the same TxId in `Promise.all` and asserts: handler runs once, exactly one response carries `Webhook-Replay: true`, exactly one `webhook_deliveries` row exists, exactly one `webhook.pay.processed` audit row exists.

### #4 — `AUDIT_ENCRYPTION_KEY` rotation story (MEDIUM severity)

**Closed 2026-05-07** in PR #59 (`<TBD>`). Migration 0027 + `lib/audit/encryption.ts` `getAuditEncryptionKeyOld()` + `scripts/rotate-audit-encryption.mjs` ship the dual-key (PRIMARY + OLD) flow. Reader uses `pgp_sym_decrypt_either` SQL helper (PL/pgSQL with EXCEPTION block) — primary tried first, OLD as fallback during the rotation window. Operator runbook in `SECURITY.md § At-rest encryption — Key rotation`.

5 unit tests pin the OLD-key resolver. 4 integration tests pin the SQL contract: helper returns NULL on both-keys-wrong (no throw), the rotation flow round-trips a row from OLD to NEW with no plaintext touch, the predicate-guarded UPDATE is idempotent (already-PRIMARY rows are skipped), the reader logs warn on invalid OLD without crashing.

## Wave 8 — Codex infra audit, 2026-05-08

Six findings against the live infra surface. Four closed (PR #80 + #82); two stay open as documented design / multi-day refactors.

### #1 MEDIUM — uptime-probe.yml leaked raw prod failure body to PUBLIC issues (closed PR #80)
Probe wrote up to 1500 chars of raw response body into GitHub issues. Repo is public; 5xx HTML / stack traces / upstream errors landed publicly. Fixed: hash body in bash, surface only sha256-prefix + length to issue.

### #2 MEDIUM-LOW — CSP unsafe-inline (Wave 11 CLOSED 2026-05-09 — full nonce-based CSP)
**Status:** closed via PRs #91/#92/#94/#95/#99/#100. Final CSP shape: both `script-src` and `style-src` are strict (`'self'` + nonce only, no `'unsafe-inline'`); `style-src-attr 'unsafe-inline'` covers ~700+ inline JSX `style={...}` attrs. Dead `fonts.googleapis.com`/`fonts.gstatic.com` allowlist entries dropped. The unblocking trick (per closed upstream vercel/next.js#43743): a Server Component must read `headers().get('x-nonce')` to put the page into dynamic-render mode, which activates Next.js's auto-stamping of `nonce=` on framework-emitted RSC hydration payload scripts. Reading `headers()` in `app/layout.tsx` does this; all pages now render dynamically (acceptable trade for our QPS). Verified live on prod: 5 inline RSC scripts on `/` all carry the response nonce; browser would refuse any injected inline script lacking it. Issue [#88](https://github.com/Igotsty1e/levelchannel/issues/88) closed.

### #3 LOW-MEDIUM — `/api/health` fingerprinting (closed PR #80)
Anonymous now sees `{status, version}` only. Detailed shape requires `X-Health-Detail` header matching `HEALTH_DETAIL_SECRET` env. Operator must set the secret (repo + prod env) for the uptime probe to get the full shape.

### #4 LOW — `X-Powered-By: Next.js` (closed PR #80)
`poweredByHeader: false` in next.config.js. nginx Server banner (`nginx/1.24.0 Ubuntu`) is operator-side: add `server_tokens off;` in `/etc/nginx/nginx.conf` http block + reload nginx.

### #5 LOW — GitHub Actions pinning (closed PR #80)
All 6 workflow files; `actions/checkout@v4` / `setup-node@v4` / `github-script@v7` pinned to commit SHAs. Comments retain the tag for diffing future updates.

### #6 LOW — systemd unit sandboxing (closed: 14 directives active, MDWE permanently incompatible with V8)

**Repo state (2026-05-09):** all 5 maintenance units (4 originals + new auth-flow-alert from Wave 5) carry 13 sandboxing directives:

- `NoNewPrivileges`
- `PrivateTmp`
- `ProtectSystem=strict`
- `ProtectHome`
- `ProtectKernelTunables` / `ProtectKernelModules` / `ProtectKernelLogs`
- `ProtectControlGroups`
- `RestrictSUIDSGID`
- `RestrictNamespaces`
- `RestrictRealtime`
- `LockPersonality`
- `SystemCallArchitectures=native`
- `SystemCallFilter=@system-service pkey_alloc pkey_mprotect pkey_free` + the `~@privileged @resources @debug @mount @cpu-emulation @obsolete` exclude

**Only 1 directive from the original PR #82 sandbox set is permanently absent: `MemoryDenyWriteExecute=true`.** V8 JIT requires writable+executable memory pages; MDWE blocks `mprotect(PROT_EXEC)` and kills Node. This is documented in `man systemd.exec` as incompatible with any JIT runtime.

**SystemCallFilter restored 2026-05-09 (closes Issue #86):** the syscall that ate Node was `pkey_alloc` (#330 on x86_64). V8 in Node 20 calls `pkey_alloc` / `pkey_mprotect` / `pkey_free` to set up Memory Protection Keys (Intel MPK / PKU) — a JIT-cache-hardening feature. Ubuntu's systemd 255 `@system-service` group does NOT include the pkey family, so vanilla `@system-service` killed V8 startup with SIGSYS (status 31). The fix is a single `SystemCallFilter=` line that adds the three pkey calls explicitly to the allowlist.

**Diagnostic procedure documented inline in `levelchannel-stale-orders.service`** so the next agent (or me, in 6 months) can repeat it for any future syscall addition. Briefly: `systemd-run` transient unit with the exact filter set, run the failing target, then `journalctl -k --since '1 minute ago' | grep audit | grep syscall` decodes the syscall number via the Linux x86_64 syscall table.

**Live-prod incident archive (2026-05-08):** PRs #82, #84 — both deployed and reverted in <2 min each due to the same SIGSYS class (later proved to be pkey_alloc). PR #85 shipped a 12-directive set without MDWE / SystemCallFilter as the pragmatic interim. PR #94 renamed the convention. PR #95 tightened style-src in CSP. Auth-flow-alert (#96) shipped on the same 12-directive interim profile; PR for the 13-directive restore (this) updates all 5 units. Total prod-degraded window: ~3 min combined.

## Wave 9 — Codex governance audit, 2026-05-08

Four findings against repo settings. All closed, but some via repo-admin actions (gh API), not git commits.

### #1 MEDIUM — branch protection too weak (closed via gh API)
Required checks expanded from `[npm run build, Verify Legal-Pipeline-Verified trailer]` to all 4: also `npm run test:integration` + `public-surface`. `strict: true` (PR must be up-to-date with main). `allow_force_pushes: false`, `allow_deletions: false`, `required_conversation_resolution: true`. Self-approval (require_approving_review_count > 0) NOT enabled — would block every solo-author PR. Reopen when teammate joins.

### #2 MEDIUM-LOW — no CODEOWNERS (closed PR #81)
`.github/CODEOWNERS` added. All security-sensitive paths owned by @Igotsty1e. Documents the trust surface map. `require_code_owner_reviews` stays false until a teammate joins.

### #3 MEDIUM-LOW — GitHub Advanced Security disabled (closed via gh API)
Enabled: `secret_scanning`, `secret_scanning_push_protection`, `dependabot_security_updates`. Two paid GHAS features stayed disabled (validity checks, non-provider patterns) — not available on public-repo free tier without an org.

### #4 LOW-MEDIUM — security workflows advisory not enforcing (implicitly closed by #1)
Branch protection now requires the integration suite + public-surface check, so they're enforcing not advisory. Same fix as #1.

## Wave 13 — Code revision (Codex 4-front sweep), 2026-05-10

Multi-front Codex adversarial pass against the whole repo. 73 findings across 4 passes (dead code / quality / tests / config). Quick wins shipped on `chore/code-revision-2026-05-10`; this section captures the deferred items.

**Shipped this wave** (PR pending): tsc clean (4 readonly-NODE_ENV errors fixed via `vi.stubEnv`), Sentry deprecation gone, 7 dead exports removed, 4 internal helpers un-exported, email-normalize consolidated to `lib/email/normalize.ts` (5 dupe sites), `rublesToKopecks` moved to `lib/payments/money.ts`, deploy-freshness workflow body-leak fixed (Pass 4 #1, same class as Wave 8 #1), 8 admin/api routes' catch-all returns `{error:'internal_error'}` 500 + log instead of leaking raw exception messages as 400, package POST uses SQLSTATE 23505 instead of brittle `msg.includes('unique')`, coverage CI gate added (was enforced in vitest config but not run), `npm test` flipped to `vitest run`, removed broken `next lint`, added `engines.node: ">=20.0.0"`, build-check matrix `[20, 22]`, removed deprecated `X-XSS-Protection` header, `DEFAULT_DISPLAY_ORDER` constant, env-var leak in `checkout-package.test.ts` (`vi.stubEnv`), SQLSTATE assertion replacing brittle text-regex on the immutability trigger, deterministic rate-limit keys.

### Deferred — refactor / split (medium-effort)

- **Wave 12 deletion-guard contract gap.** `accountHasInFlightPackageGrant` was deleted as dead in this wave; the function existed for the two-branch deletion guard in design v9 but was never wired into `requestAccountDeletion` or `scripts/db-retention-cleanup.mjs`. Today the 30-day grace period mitigates: any in-flight grant either succeeds or hits one of the 7 fail-closed reasons within minutes, well before the 30-day purge fires. Action: either re-introduce the helper and wire into the schedule-step + execute-step (matching the design), OR explicitly close the design contract gap in `docs/plans/prepay-postpay-billing.md` v9.

- ~~**Split god-modules** (Pass 1 #9-#13).~~ **Closed 2026-05-11 across Waves 39-42.**
  - Pass 1 #9 `lib/scheduling/slots.ts` (1746 → 9-file folder). Wave 39 (PR #150) v3 design accepted by Codex round 3 GOOD-AS-IS; Wave 40 (PR #151) implementation, Codex post-merge CLEAN. Every file ≤358 lines, facade keeps `@/lib/scheduling/slots`.
  - Pass 1 #10 `lib/payments/provider.ts` (525 → lifecycle 212 + checkout 343 + facade 24). Wave 41 (PR #152), Codex CLEAN.
  - Pass 1 #11 `lib/payments/cloudpayments-route.ts` (498 lines). **Investigated, NOT split.** The file is ~one function (`handleCloudPaymentsWebhook`) with private helpers (`runWebhookPipeline`, `processSerialized`, `acquireClientWithTimeout`, `readTransactionId`, `computeRequestFingerprint`, `jsonResponse`) plus two log-tag constants. Sequential webhook workflow; splitting would fragment a coherent ordered pipeline (HMAC verify → parse → dedup-lock → handler → record → commit) into modules that would call each other in a fixed order anyway. Net review-burden gain: low. Decision: leave as-is.
  - Pass 1 #12 `lib/billing/packages.ts` (373 → catalog 166 + purchases 148 + debt 58 + facade 25). Wave 42 (PR #153), Codex CLEAN.
  - Pass 1 #13 `lib/telemetry/store.ts` (168 lines). **Investigated, NOT split.** Under any reasonable cap; 3 public exports (`CheckoutTelemetryEvent` type, `buildCheckoutTelemetryEvent`, `appendCheckoutTelemetryEvent`). The Codex "4 responsibilities" framing (normalization + HMAC + file backend + postgres fallback) overstates the scope: HMAC is 5 lines, file backend is 30 lines, postgres path is already delegated to `lib/telemetry/store-postgres.ts`. Decision: leave as-is.

### Deferred — API contract consistency

- ~~**Status code semantics** (Pass 2 #11).~~ **Closed Wave 26 (2026-05-10, PR #137, SHA 62d8885).** `editOpenSlot` and `deleteOpenSlot` now return discriminated unions matching `moveOpenSlot`. Routes map ok→200, not_found→404, not_open→409. 4 new integration tests pin both branches.
- ~~**Malformed JSON consistency** (Pass 2 #12-#14).~~ **Closed Wave 25 (2026-05-10, PR #136, SHA d338d16).** Admin and learner cancel routes match teacher: empty body OK, malformed body → 400 "Invalid JSON body." (was silent-swallow to `{}` — invisible audit-trail loss). +2 integration tests.
- ~~**charge-token contract polish** (Pass 2 #15-#16).~~ **Closed Wave 16 inline.** Decline reshaped to `{error:'declined', message, order}` and all returns use `NextResponse.json` (was `Response.json` for early errors). See `app/api/payments/charge-token/route.ts:43-273`.
- ~~**Error code vs message** (Pass 2 #17-#20).~~ **Closed 2026-05-11 across Waves 33-36 (PRs #144, #145, #146, #147).** 4-wave sequenced rollout:
  - Wave 33 (PR #144) — UI consumers across cabinet/admin/checkout/thank-you/payments switched to `data.message || data.error || fallback`. Safe no-op until routes emit `message`.
  - Wave 34 (PR #145) — payment routes (`charge-token`, `saved-card`, `events`, `cancel`, `stream`, mock-confirm, GET) reshaped. Codes: `invalid_invoice_id`, `not_found`, `session_required`, `invalid_email`, `invalid_request_body`, `invalid_amount`, `consent_required`, `no_saved_card`, `one_click_unavailable`, `mock_confirm_disabled`, `invalid_event_type`.
  - Wave 35 (PR #146) — slot routes (admin + teacher + learner cancel + book-as-operator + mark + bulk-create + move). Codes: `invalid_json_body`, `body_must_be_object`, `slot_not_cancellable`, `not_booked`, `not_yet_started`, `learner_not_found`, `learner_email_unverified`, `learner_disabled`, `in_past`, `self_booking_blocked`, `not_open`, `internal_role_check`.
  - Wave 36 (PR #147) — admin/accounts (disable/role/teacher) + admin/pricing/[id]. Codes: `invalid_body`, `cannot_disable_self`, `invalid_role`, `invalid_op`, `cannot_revoke_admin_self`, `not_a_teacher`, `not_found`.
  - Intentional exceptions: auth routes (register/login/reset-*) keep human strings as their stable contract — UI copy maps 1:1; not a code-vs-message issue.
- ~~**MSK constants** (Pass 2 #22).~~ **Closed Wave 27 (2026-05-10, PR #138, SHA 898eef4).** Extracted `MSK_BUSINESS_HOUR_MIN/MAX`, `SLOT_GRID_MINUTES`, and `validateSlotStartMsk(startMs)` into `lib/scheduling/slots.ts`. Both move routes call the helper. Behavior unchanged.
- **`readJsonObjectOr400` helper** (Pass 2 #23). JSON-body parse + "must be object" validation is duplicated across many routes. Helper would centralize behavior + error message. **Partially closed Wave 16** — helper exists at `lib/api/json-body.ts`, used in admin packages + admin slots routes; sweep to remaining routes still pending.
- **`NO_STORE` casing convention** (Pass 2 #24). Mixed `noStore` vs `NO_STORE` for the same constant pattern across routes. Pick one and normalize. **Partially closed Wave 13** — most routes converted to `NO_STORE`; spot-fix new sites as touched.
- ~~**`/api/health` swallow** (Pass 2 #25).~~ **Closed Wave 13/16 inline.** `probeDatabase` now logs to journald with `[health.probe]` tag, surfaces `err.code` (PG SQLSTATE), `err.name`, message truncated at 200 chars to prevent driver-string credential leak. See `app/api/health/route.ts:43-66`.

### Deferred — test improvements

- ~~**SSE stream determinism** (Pass 3 #2).~~ **Closed Wave 23 (2026-05-10, PR #134, SHA 08555b2).** Replaced 50ms sleep with explicit first-chunk read on the SSE body — the route's `start()` is synchronous (enqueue initial state THEN subscribe), so reading the first chunk pins both the handshake and subscription. Removed the now-unused `readSseUntilTerminal` helper. Test runtime ~3-5s → 180ms.
- **Wall-clock parity tests** (Pass 3 #3-#4). `auth/register.test.ts:121` and `auth/login.test.ts:61` assert on `performance.now()` deltas to verify constant-time/dummy-hash equivalence. Inherently flaky under variable IO/load. Replace with structural assertion (spy/mock the dummy-hash + no-op email path) instead of elapsed time. Or gate behind `PERF_STABLE_MODE=1`.
- ~~**Audit ordering by sleep** (Pass 3 #5).~~ **Closed Wave 22 (2026-05-10, PR #133, SHA 3e55cde).** Replaced 5ms sleep with explicit `update payment_audit_events set created_at = created_at - interval '1 second'` on the first row — guarantees strict ordering regardless of clock-tick resolution.
- ~~**Missing security test cases** (Pass 3 #6-#7).~~ **Closed Wave 21 (2026-05-10, PR #132, SHA 3dcc1dc).** Added 6 negative-case 401 tests (missing/wrong/cross-invoice receipt-token) on both SSE stream and /cancel routes. Cross-invoice cancel test verifies the gate did not mutate either order AND no `order.cancelled` audit event fired.
- ~~**Deterministic invoice IDs** (Pass 3 #8-#10).~~ **Closed Wave 24 (2026-05-10, PR #135, SHA 5cbe7c9).** New `freshInvoiceId(prefix)` helper backed by `crypto.randomUUID()` (122 bits vs the prior ~38). 10 ad-hoc generators across `helpers.ts` + 5 test files (webhooks, booking, admin, checkout-package, webhook-dedup) consolidated.
- ~~**Test fixture extraction** (Pass 3 #11-#13).~~ **Closed Wave 20 (2026-05-10, PR #131, SHA e5d05f7).** Extracted `seedPaymentOrder()`, `seedOrderCreatedAudit()`, `assertIntegrationDbEnv()` into `tests/integration/helpers.ts`. Wave 24 added `freshInvoiceId()` to the same module.
- ~~**Log-string brittleness** (Pass 3 #14-#17).~~ **Closed Wave 31 (2026-05-11, PR #142).** Repo grep narrowed the original "4 tests" claim to 1 actual case in `tests/payments/cloudpayments-webhook-dedup.test.ts:263`. Fixed by exporting `LOG_TAG_WEBHOOK_DEDUP` + `LOG_TAG_WEBHOOK_DEDUP_FINGERPRINT_MISMATCH` from `lib/payments/cloudpayments-route.ts`. Runtime warns + test assertion both reference the same constant; trailing message text is free to evolve.
- ~~**deletion-grace fake timer** (Pass 3 #19).~~ **Closed Wave 22 (2026-05-10, PR #133, SHA 3e55cde).** Replaced 10ms sleep with explicit `update accounts set scheduled_purge_at = scheduled_purge_at - interval '1 minute'`. New assertions prove the function rewrites the row to a fresh `now()+30d` (not just preserves it) AND that the recomputed value sits within 5s of the original.

### Deferred — flake (pre-existing, not caused by Wave 13)

- ~~**Test isolation bug**:~~ **Closed Wave 15 (2026-05-10).** Replaced the fixed slotId UUID `11111111-2222-3333-4444-555555555555` in `tests/integration/payment/allocations.test.ts` with `crypto.randomUUID()` per test. The 3-files-cross-contamination class of failure no longer reproduces.

### Deferred — config / build minor

- ~~**postbuild.js always runs** (Pass 4 #6).~~ **Closed Wave 29 (2026-05-11, PR #140, SHA 653e005).** Default `build` is now `next build` only; `build:export` is the explicit static-export path. postbuild.js gains a header comment documenting the gate.
- ~~**Workflow direct-bash vs npm-alias** (Pass 4 #8-#9).~~ **Closed Wave 30 (2026-05-11, PR #141, SHA 3ff30e2).** Dropped the unused `check:public-surface` and `test:seccomp` npm aliases — repo grep found zero callers using the npm form. CI workflows + pre-commit hook all invoke the bash script directly, which is now the single source of truth. README updated.
- **build-check Node matrix [20, 22]** (Pass 4 #5, partially deferred). `engines.node: ">=20.0.0"` is declared in `package.json` but CI runs only Node 22. Adding the matrix back requires updating branch protection's required-check contexts at the same time (`npm run build (node 20)` + `npm run build (node 22)` instead of `npm run build`). Two-PR sequence: (1) update protection contexts, (2) restore matrix in build-check.yml. Today the `engines` declaration is documentation; it's not enforced.

- ~~**postcss override redundancy** (Pass 4 #10).~~ **Closed Wave 27 sweep (2026-05-10).** Investigated by dropping the override and re-running `npm install`: `next@16.2.4` immediately falls back to `postcss@8.4.31` transitively. The override is genuinely needed as a forward pin. Restored. Closing as "verified necessary, not redundant" — the package.json comment is impossible (strict JSON), the explanation lives here for future archeology.

## Wave 12 — Billing wave (prepay + postpay), 2026-05-10

7 PRs merged on main on 2026-05-10 after 9-round Codex paranoia loop. Migrations 0032 (legal-versioning sister wave), 0033 (billing schema), 0034 (audit enum widening). Feature flag `BILLING_WAVE_ACTIVE=false` on prod by default — flip after the operator runs the legal-rf cascade on PR 5's oferta draft (done; QA verdict GO 2026-05-10). Implementation log: `docs/plans/prepay-postpay-billing.md` v9 (915 lines, Codex SIGN-OFF). Cross-project retro: `~/Obsidian/Brain/wiki/synthesis/billing-wave-execution-2026-05-10.md`.

### Open follow-ups (non-blocking for flip)

- ~~**BookConfirmModal billing-preview banner.**~~ **Closed Wave 18 (2026-05-10, PR #129, SHA bb6d9a6).** `BillingPreview` component renders the appropriate banner inside the existing confirm modal: package-consumption / postpay / single-payment fallback. FIFO ordering pinned by package `expires_at` (matching the server-side consumption order). Codex review caught and fixed two BLOCK issues during the wave (FIFO-mismatch + 409-race detection).

- ~~**`/api/admin/packages` PATCH (edit existing catalog rows).**~~ **Closed Wave 15 (2026-05-10).** New `app/api/admin/packages/[id]/route.ts` PATCH allows edits only on `title_ru`, `description_ru`, `is_active`, `display_order`. The DB trigger keeps refusing economic fields (`amount_kopecks`, `count`, `duration_minutes`, `currency`); the route layer pre-validates and returns a clean 400 instead of letting the trigger fire a 500. Slug is also non-editable by design (it's the public stable identifier in checkout URLs).

- ~~**Refund-flow Phase 7.**~~ **Closed across Waves 50–54 (2026-05-11, PRs #161, #162, #163, #165, #166).** Five-stage rollout:
  - Stage A (Wave 50, PR #161) — migration 0036 ships `payment_allocation_reversals` (composite FK to `payment_allocations` PK, since allocations have no surrogate uuid). Wired anti-joins into `slotIsPaidByAllocations`, `listAccountPostpaidDebt`, and `listSlotPaidStatus` so a reversed allocation drops from the paid total. `lib/billing/reversals.ts` adds tx-aware data helpers. Codex round caught a HIGH (debt.ts left old `par.allocation_id = pa.id` SQL after schema rewrite) — fixed before merge.
  - Stage B (Wave 51, PR #162) — `POST /api/admin/refunds` admin endpoint. Books a reversal in tx + emits new `payment.refund.recorded` audit event (migration 0037 widens the CHECK). Initial contract: 201 / 400 / 404 / 409 (already_refunded surfaces existing reversalId). Scope at this stage: `kind='lesson_slot'` only with strict-equality `refundedKopecks == amount`. Codex round caught a HIGH (route accepted `refundedKopecks < amount` which would mark slot fully unpaid because the read paths drop on row existence, not amount match) — fixed before merge with strict equality + `partial_refund_not_supported` error code.
  - Stage C (Wave 52, PR #163) — cabinet refund-pending UI. New `listSlotPaymentState` returns `paid` / `refunded` per slot. `app/cabinet/page.tsx` threads two sets (paid + refunded) to `LessonsSection`; the booked-slot pill renders a neutral grey "возврат оформлен" instead of the yellow "оплатить X₽" CTA (which would suggest the learner needs to pay again).
  - Stage D (Wave 53, PR #165) — `kind='package'` refunds. Migration 0038 adds `package_purchases.voided_at`; `restoreAllConsumptionsForPurchase` (in `lib/billing/consumption.ts`) voids the purchase + UPDATEs every active consumption in one tx. Admin endpoint extends to accept `kind='package'`; response surfaces `packageRestored: { restoredConsumptions, alreadyVoided }`. Package refunds remain full-amount-only — partial package refund would need a proportional-restore model that's out of scope.
  - Stage E (Wave 54, PR #166) — partial reversals for `kind='lesson_slot'`. Migration 0039 drops the `UNIQUE(payment_order_id, kind, target_id)` constraint on reversals so an allocation can carry 0..N rows. The four read paths switch to LATERAL `SUM(refunded_kopecks)` with a binary all-or-nothing contract: an allocation contributes its full amount while `SUM < amount_kopecks`, contributes 0 once SUM hits coverage. Admin endpoint pre-reads the running sum and asserts `prior + this <= amount` with a `SELECT ... FOR UPDATE` row lock for concurrent-refund serialization (Codex post-review HIGH). Test matrix adds partial-stays-paid + sequential-partials-flip-to-refunded coverage and pins all 4 read paths to the same binary semantic. Replaces the legacy `409 already_refunded` with `400 refund_exceeds_allocation`.
  - **Out-of-scope for this wave:** partial `kind='package'` refunds (would need proportional consumption restore), payment-gateway-side automation (today: operator pushes the actual money via CloudPayments dashboard and records the reversal here after).

- ~~**Email notifications for package grant outcomes.**~~ **Closed Wave 15 (2026-05-10).** `sendOperatorPackageGrantFailureNotification` fires on every `package.grant.failed` audit event in `lib/billing/package-grant.ts:212`. Best-effort dispatch — Resend outage / missing `OPERATOR_NOTIFY_EMAIL` is logged but does not turn a 200-no-retry semantic into a 5xx-retry.

- ~~**Legal-versioning admin UI + public history surface.**~~ **Closed Wave 19 (2026-05-10, PR #130, SHA 6286419).** Admin UI at `/admin/legal/versions` (manager component + create-new-version form). Public surface at `/legal/v/[id]` rendering historical bodies via a safe minimal markdown renderer (no JSX deps). `createLegalVersion` uses `pg_advisory_xact_lock` per-kind to serialize publishes (Codex round 2 BLOCK fix on chain fork under READ COMMITTED).

- ~~**Full-body markdown backfill for legal versions.**~~ **Closed Wave 48 (2026-05-11, PR #159, SHA 29dd723).** Markdown templates in `scripts/legal-v1-templates/` mirror the JSX content with `{{TOKEN}}` placeholders for operator env-vars. `scripts/backfill-legal-v1-bodies.mjs` is an operator-runs-once script that materializes the templates against `process.env` (`/etc/levelchannel/env` on prod) and UPDATEs the three v1 rows transactionally — fail-closed on missing rows or missing env. `scripts/legal-pipeline-check.sh` now covers the new template paths so future edits go through the legal-rf cascade. Note: public `/offer`, `/privacy`, `/consent/personal-data` still render from JSX — only `/legal/v/<v1-id>` changes after the operator runs the script.

- **Monthly billing aggregator (admin debt summary).** `listAccountPostpaidDebt` returns per-account unpaid postpaid lessons. The admin page renders this per-account but there's no aggregate view ("показать всех клиентов с долгом > X ₽" / "выгрузить в CSV"). For early postpay rollout (admin grants postpay manually to known-good clients), the per-account view is enough. Add when postpay scales beyond ~10 accounts.

- ~~**Per-PR Codex adversarial code review.**~~ **Closed 2026-05-11 across Waves 45-47.** Codex sweep on PRs #117–#123 against design v9 invariants found 2 HIGH + 2 MEDIUM:
  - **HIGH 1** receipt-token + idempotency bypass on `/api/checkout/package/[slug]` → Wave 45 (PR #156). Token now minted + persisted; flow wrapped in `withIdempotency(scope=checkout:package:${slug}:${accountId}, ...)`. Codex post-review caught the scope-leak case (constant scope + empty body would replay across packages/accounts) — fixed before merge.
  - **HIGH 2** package-grant taxonomy drift → Wave 46 (PR #157). Removed dead `decrypt_failed` reason; renamed `no_ciphertext`→`no_customer_email`; added audit + Resend on `package_unknown_or_inactive`; emit `package.grant.succeeded` on both fresh-grant and idempotent-replay branches; threaded `PackageGrantActor` ('webhook:cloudpayments:pay' vs 'mock:auto_confirm') through all 11 audit calls. Codex post-review caught actor misattribution on inline mock path — fixed before merge.
  - **MEDIUM 1** legacy fast-path response now carries additive `billing: { kind: 'legacy' }` field → Wave 47 (this PR). Documented in `docs/plans/prepay-postpay-billing.md` as intentional additive contract, NOT a regression.
  - **MEDIUM 2** cabinet postpaid `/checkout/${tariffId}` should be `${tariffSlug}` → Wave 45 (PR #156). Surface `tariffSlug` from `listAccountPostpaidDebt` join. Codex post-review caught archived-tariff 404 case — fixed by adding `t.is_active=true` to the join.
  - **Deferred (pre-existing global helper bug):** `withIdempotency` TOCTOU between getRecord and INSERT-ON-CONFLICT could let two parallel requests both execute side effects. Predates Wave 12, affects `/api/payments` equally. Future wave: add `pg_advisory_xact_lock` per (scope, idempotency_key).

## Wave 10 — Codex legal/compliance audit, 2026-05-08

Four findings against public legal surface. One closed in code (#5); three need operator/lawyer involvement.

### #1 HIGH — RKN personal-data operator notification (filed by IP 2026-05-08, awaiting registry number for citation)
**Status:** filed by Ivan on 2026-05-08. **Remaining work:** when РКН confirms registration, capture (a) date of registry inclusion, (b) operator's registry number (номер в реестре операторов ПДн). Add a one-line citation to `app/privacy/page.tsx` §1 («Оператор включён в реестр операторов, осуществляющих обработку персональных данных, № {N} от {дата}, под номером {N}»). Single-file ~3-line PR, low risk, no need for a fresh legal-rf cascade — narrow attributive update like Wave 10 #2.

### #2 HIGH — IP disclosure missing required fields (closed PR #87)
**Status:** closed 2026-05-08. **What landed:** 3 new env-driven fields (`NEXT_PUBLIC_LEGAL_OPERATOR_OGRN`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_LEGAL_OPERATOR_REG_AUTHORITY`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_LEGAL_OPERATOR_CLAIMS_ADDRESS`) wired into 4 public surfaces: `app/offer/page.tsx` §11 grid, `app/privacy/page.tsx` §1 + claims-mail line, `app/consent/personal-data/page.tsx` §1 + claims-mail line, `components/home/home-page-client.tsx` footer. Routed through `legal-rf-router` (2026-05-08): narrow attributive disclosure addition per ст. 9 ЗоЗПП + 152-ФЗ ст. 5 ч. 4. Verified live on prod after autodeploy. Backlog: Wave 10 #2b — рассмотреть отдельный почтовый адрес для претензий взамен домашнего, если возрастёт нагрузка от B2C-обращений.

### #3 HIGH — refund/cancellation terms too aggressive (closed PR ?)
**Status:** closed 2026-05-08. **What landed:** rewrite of `app/offer/page.tsx` §5 and §8. Removed null-and-void provisions per ст. 16 ЗоЗПП («занятие считается проведённым, оплата не возвращается» при late-cancel). Replaced with ст. 32-compliant wording: (a) completed lesson — non-refundable, (b) ≥24h cancel — credit forward or §8 refund, (c) late-cancel <24h — Исполнитель holds price as «согласованный сторонами размер фактически понесённых расходов» (defensive drafting per legal-rf-qa) with explicit safe-harbours (illness with med doc, force majeure, slot resold), (d) Исполнитель-side cancel — full refund within 10 days. Refund formula for packages: oplata ÷ N − used lessons − late-cancel withholdings. Cited ст. 32 + ст. 31 ЗоЗПП. Routed through full pipeline: `legal-rf-router → legal-rf-private-client → legal-rf-qa (2026-05-08)`. QA flagged 2 critical issues (wrong norm citation ст. 22 → ст. 31; ambiguous «согласованная цена» — fixed via explicit formula). Verified live on prod after autodeploy.

### #5 MEDIUM — CloudPayments script global load (closed PR #80)
Was loaded from `app/layout.tsx` on every page. Moved to `/pay` and `/checkout/[tariffSlug]` only.

## Wave 7 — Codex pass on Wave-6.1-Phase-1.5 surface, 2026-05-08

Codex left a fresh handoff in `~/.team/activity.jsonl` on 2026-05-08 04:13Z. Five findings against the post-Phase-1.5 state. Four closed; one remains as a documented design decision rather than a code fix.

### #1 HIGH — slot payment-binding bypass (closed PR #78)

`/api/payments` accepted any UUID as `slotId`. Webhook on `pay` bound the invoice via `payment_allocations` without checking ownership / tariff / amount. Bypass: a learner could pay 1₽ with another learner's slotId and operator UI would show their invoice attached to a slot they didn't own.

**Closed:** `lib/payments/slot-binding.ts` — request-time gate (session + ownership + status='booked' + tariff match within 1-kopeck tolerance). Anonymous callers can't pass slotId.

### #1b HIGH defence-in-depth — webhook-side allocation guard (closing here)

The PR #78 fix gates the request path. The webhook is a different trust boundary (HMAC, no session) — a future regression that re-introduces an unguarded path to set `order.metadata.slotId` would still produce poisoned allocations. So before `recordAllocation`, the webhook handler now looks up the customer's account by email and re-runs `validatePaymentSlotBinding`. On mismatch: skip the insert + log loud warning (does NOT block the webhook ack — order stays paid, allocation just doesn't land).

### #2 MEDIUM — `/api/slots/available` filter override + DTO leak (closed PR #78)

Authenticated learner could pass `?teacher=<uuid>` to override their assigned-teacher filter, AND received the full LessonSlot DTO with `teacher_email` + internal account IDs.

**Closed:** session forces `teacherFilter = session.account.assignedTeacherId`; both anon + authed learner project to public DTO via `toPublicSlot`.

### #3 MEDIUM-LOW — teacher-role enforcement on slot/account assignments (closing here)

`assigned_teacher_id` and `slot.teacher_account_id` were not validated against the actual `teacher` role — admin route shape-checked the UUID and trusted whatever was passed.

**Closed:**
  - `lib/auth/accounts.ts:setAssignedTeacher` throws `AssignedTeacherRoleError` when target lacks the `teacher` role; `app/api/admin/accounts/[id]/teacher/route.ts` returns 400 with a translated message.
  - `lib/scheduling/slots.ts:createSlot` and `bulkCreateSlots` throw `SlotTeacherRoleError`; both admin routes return 400.
  - The data-layer `bookSlot` self-booking invariant (Codex #5 from 2026-05-07) is preserved as a final defence.

### #4 LOW — rate-limit PG-fallback debt (documented, not closed in code)

`lib/security/rate-limit.ts` falls back to in-memory buckets when `takePostgresBucket` fails. Memory buckets don't share state across processes, so:

  - **Single-instance** (today): fail-open on PG outage = app keeps working with per-process rate limiting. Acceptable trade-off — losing rate limits during a PG outage is preferable to 503-ing every request.
  - **Multi-instance** (future): an attacker who can specifically take down Postgres bypasses the global per-IP cap because each app process has its own counter. Mitigation: nginx `limit_req` (already configured) is the last line. Real fix would require a process-shared cache (Redis) — out of scope until multi-instance becomes the deploy shape.

This was reviewed and the current fail-open behaviour was retained as the right policy for the current deploy topology. No code change in this batch. Re-open the question when the deploy topology changes (multi-instance, Render, k8s, etc.).

## Wave 6 — Codex pass on older app surface, 2026-05-07

Codex adversarial review of the OLDER surface (out of scope for the earlier review which covered only the recent security batch). Six findings; one CRITICAL closed in PR #63, four still open below, one duplicate of Wave 4 #4b (XFF). For each: severity, bypass shape, file:line, fix sketch. Schedule per severity; #3 + #5 are both 1-2h fixes worth picking off next.

### #3 HIGH — learner can cancel a terminal slot or skip the 24h rule on a race boundary (closed PR #64)

**Status:** closed 2026-05-07. **What landed:** new `cancelLearnerSlot` in `lib/scheduling/slots.ts:943` folds ownership + `status='booked'` + `start_at - now() >= interval '24 hours'` into a single atomic UPDATE WHERE clause. Route `app/api/slots/[id]/cancel/route.ts:31` delegates and disambiguates verdict (`not_found` / `not_owner` / `already_terminal` / `too_late_to_cancel`) by re-reading the row only when 0 rows updated — the disambiguation is for UX, the authoritative decision lives in the UPDATE. Tests: `tests/scheduling/cancel-route-disambiguation.test.ts` covers all 4 verdicts; `tests/integration/scheduling/lifecycle.test.ts` covers the 24h boundary live against Postgres.

### #4 HIGH — `invoiceId` is treated as a capability-secret (Phase 2 closed PR #77; Phase 3 time-based follow-up)

**Status:** Phase 1 + 1.5 + 2 closed; Phase 3 deferred until Phase 2 has soaked 7+ days.

**What landed (PR #77, 2026-05-07):**
- Migration 0030 — `payment_orders.receipt_token_hash` (nullable, partial unique index).
- `createOrder` mints 32-byte token (`crypto.randomBytes(32).toString('base64url')`), stores sha256 hash, returns plain token in the `POST /api/payments` response.
- Gate `lib/payments/receipt-token-gate.ts:evaluateReceiptGate` — accepts `?token=<plain>` query param or `X-Receipt-Token` header, hashes presented value, compares with `crypto.timingSafeEqual` against the stored hash. 24h legacy-grace window for pre-wave NULL-token rows.
- Wired into all 3 capability routes: `app/api/payments/[invoiceId]/route.ts:46`, `app/api/payments/[invoiceId]/cancel/route.ts`, `app/api/payments/[invoiceId]/stream/route.ts`.
- UI threading: `components/payments/pricing-section.tsx` (redirect carries `?token=<encoded>`, poll/SSE/cancel send `X-Receipt-Token`); `app/thank-you/page.tsx` reads the URL token once, keeps it in component state for subsequent fetches.
- Tests: `tests/payments/receipt-token-gate.test.ts` covers the four reject reasons + happy path; integration suite asserts the redirect-with-token works AND that curl-without-token on an aged order returns 401.

**Phase 3 — drop legacy grace window (open).** When Phase 2 has been in prod for ≥7 days without a rollback need, drop the 24h `LEGACY_GRACE_MS` branch in `evaluateReceiptGate`. Pre-wave orders become unreachable via these routes (intentional end-state — operators have audit-log access, customers got their receipt email). One-line code change + drop the legacy test case. Calendar trigger: ≈2026-05-15.

### #5 MEDIUM — self-booking not enforced at the data layer (closed PRs #65 + #79)

**Status:** closed. **What landed:**
- **PR #65** — DB invariant: `bookSlot()` UPDATE adds `and teacher_account_id <> $2` in the WHERE (`lib/scheduling/slots.ts:861`). Post-update sniff distinguishes `self_booking_blocked` so the route returns a clean 400 instead of a generic conflict.
- **PR #79** — Role enforcement at the admin route layer: `setAssignedTeacher` (`lib/auth/accounts.ts`) throws `AssignedTeacherRoleError` when the target lacks the `teacher` role; `createSlot` / `bulkCreateSlots` (`lib/scheduling/slots.ts`) throw `SlotTeacherRoleError` when the target isn't a teacher; the corresponding admin routes return 400 with translated messages.
- All 3 layers from the original Codex fix sketch landed; the DB invariant is the last line.

## Wave 5 — auth observability

### Auth audit log + slow-brute-force alerting (Phase 1 + 2 shipped earlier; Phase 3 shipping now)

**Status:** Phase 1 (schema) + Phase 2 (recorder + 6 routes wired) shipped before this session — verified by reading the live code. Phase 3 (alerting) shipping now.

**What's already in code (pre-this-session):**
- Migration `0028_auth_audit_events.sql` — separate table from `payment_audit_events` (domain separation rationale documented in the migration header). Indexes for `(email_hash, time)`, `(client_ip, time)`, `(event_type, time)`, `(account_id, time)`.
- `lib/audit/auth-events.ts` — recorder, sibling of `lib/audit/payment-events.ts`. Best-effort, swallows failures so auth flow is never blocked by an audit-table outage.
- 6 routes wired: `login`, `register`, `reset-request`, `reset-confirm`, `verify`, `logout`. Failed login attempts record `ip` + `userAgent` + email-hash (HMAC-SHA256 keyed by `AUTH_RATE_LIMIT_SECRET`) — never raw email, per privacy carve-out in the migration header.
- Retention: 180 days, folded into the existing daily `scripts/db-retention-cleanup.mjs` cleanup.
- Unit tests: `tests/audit/auth-events.test.ts`.

**What ships now (Phase 3):**
- `scripts/auth-flow-alert.mjs` — sibling of `scripts/webhook-flow-alert.mjs`. Aggregates `auth.login.failed` rows in the last 60 min, alerts when any IP exceeds 50 failures or any email_hash exceeds 20 failures.
- `scripts/systemd/levelchannel-auth-flow-alert.{service,timer}` — every 30 min, offset 7 min from boot to stagger DB load with the webhook-flow alert (which fires at 5 min).
- Unit tests for `decideVerdict`: `tests/audit/auth-flow-alert.test.ts` (6/6 pass).
- Sandboxing: 12-directive set per Wave 11 confirmed-compatible profile.

**Operator-side activation (post-merge):** scp the new unit + timer to `/etc/systemd/system/`, `daemon-reload`, `enable --now levelchannel-auth-flow-alert.timer`. Same pattern as the webhook-flow alert.

## Wave 4 — security hardening from Codex review 2026-05-07

Codex adversarial pass after the Wave 3 batch landed found six real issues my self-review missed (0/6 catch-rate vs 6/6 Codex). Five of the six were closed in the same-day PR (`.local` mDNS TLS bypass, audit-encryption scripts bypassing the TLS gate, rotate-script wrong-OLD-key false-success, missing-TransactionId webhook replay, `pool.connect()` no acquisition timeout, anonymous slot DTO leak). One stays open here because it needs operator-side coordination, not just a code change:

### #4b — `getClientIp()` trusts raw `x-forwarded-for` first hop (closed — code + nginx prereq verified 2026-05-09)

**Status:** closed. Code-side fix landed in an earlier commit; today's audit verified the nginx prerequisite is in place.

**What's in code (`lib/security/request.ts:33-63`):** `getClientIp` now reads only `x-real-ip` (or `cf-connecting-ip` as secondary if Cloudflare is ever placed in front; today there isn't one). `x-forwarded-for` parsing dropped entirely. Inline comment documents the rationale: nginx's `proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr` always **overwrites** whatever the client sent (because `proxy_set_header` is overwriting, unlike `$proxy_add_x_forwarded_for` which appends).

**What's on nginx (verified 2026-05-09 via `grep proxy_set_header /etc/nginx/sites-available/levelchannel`):**
```
proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
```
The `X-Real-IP` value the app sees is bound to the actual TCP-connected address, not anything the client controls. The XFF chain still appends but the app no longer consumes it.

**Net:** per-IP rate-limit buckets (auth, webhooks) are now keyed by the real socket IP. Per-XFF-rotation bypass closed.

## Cabinet expansion (next phases)

Guest checkout is not touched: subsequent phases are additive.

Already closed and not in the backlog:

- Phase 0 stabilization
- Phase 1A auth foundation
- Phase 1B auth API routes
- Phase 2 auth UI
- Phase 3 profiles + admin pricing — **closed 2026-05-04**. Migrations 0017 / 0018 / 0019. Cabinet got profile editor, consent withdrawal, and 30-day-grace account deletion. Operator-side admin surface at `/admin` (dashboard, accounts list / detail, pricing CRUD) gated by `requireAdminRole`. Bootstrap via `scripts/grant-admin.mjs`. The retention cleanup job picks up rows where `scheduled_purge_at <= now()` and anonymizes them. Public `/pay` left free-amount in this wave; catalog wiring is in this same backlog under "Cabinet Phase 6 deferments". See `docs/plans/phase-3-profiles-admin-pricing.md`.
- Phase 4 scheduling — **closed 2026-05-04**. Migration 0020 (`lesson_slots`). Operator-managed slot model with one row per concrete `start_at`. Admin surface at `/admin/slots` covers single-slot create + bulk recurring with weekday/weeks/skip-dates preview-deselect-commit + per-row cancel/delete + book-as-operator. Cabinet «Мои уроки» + «Записаться» sections in `/cabinet`. Booking gated by `requireAuthenticatedAndVerified` (D2). Atomic UPDATE-with-`status='open'` re-assert prevents concurrent-book races (loser → 409). Per-row `events JSONB` event log; no separate audit table. Payment-free in this wave (Phase 6 wires payment); 24-hour cancellation rule deferred to Phase 5. See `docs/plans/phase-4-scheduling.md`.
- Phase 5 lesson lifecycle + 24h rule — **closed 2026-05-04**. Migration 0021 extended the `lesson_slots.status` enum with `completed`, `no_show_learner`, `no_show_teacher` and added a nullable `marked_at` column. Learner cancel route now refuses with 403 + `error: 'too_late_to_cancel'` when `start_at - now() < 24h`; admin / operator routes bypass the gate (override). New `POST /api/admin/slots/[id]/mark` lets the operator stamp lifecycle on past-booked rows. New daily systemd timer `levelchannel-auto-complete-slots` (03:30 UTC) flips still-`booked` rows whose `start_at + duration_minutes` has elapsed to `completed`. Cabinet UI splits «Мои уроки» into Предстоящие / Прошедшие and shows the lifecycle status. Admin `/admin/slots` rows get «Прошёл» / «Не пришёл (учащийся)» / «Не пришёл (учитель)» buttons on past-booked rows; status filter gains «проведённые» / «не пришли». See `docs/plans/phase-5-lifecycle-24h-rule.md`.
- Phase 6 cabinet payment (tariff-bound checkout) — **closed 2026-05-04**. Migration 0022 added `payment_allocations` (kind enum starts with `lesson_slot`, forward-compatible with packages later) and a nullable `lesson_slots.tariff_id` FK to `pricing_tariffs`. New public surface `/checkout/[tariffSlug]` runs in parallel with the existing `/pay` (free-amount) — `/pay` stays bit-for-bit unchanged. Optional `?slot=<uuid>` binds the resulting paid invoice to a `lesson_slot` via `payment_allocations` written from the CloudPayments `webhook.pay.processed` handler. Cabinet «Мои уроки» surfaces «оплатить XXXX ₽» / «оплачено» pills next to booked future slots whose `tariff_id` is non-null. Admin `/admin/slots` create + bulk forms get an optional «Тариф» dropdown; the slot list shows the bound tariff slug + amount. Refund / credit on cancellation is **deliberately parked**: a learner cancelling a paid booking leaves `payment_orders` + `payment_allocations` rows in place; operator handles refund manually via the CloudPayments dashboard for now, until refund volume justifies a clean refund flow (Phase 7). Saved-card 1-click checkout still scoped to free-amount `/pay`. See `docs/plans/phase-6-cabinet-payment.md`.

Open high-level queue:

- ~~**Calendar / grid UI for slots**~~: **Wave A shipped 2026-05-08** (read-only contract). PR1 #106 backend (migration 0031 + `/api/slots/calendar` endpoint + 3 CHECK constraints + role-precedence DTO union), PR2 #107 component skeleton (`<SlotCalendar />` + Grid/Toolbar/MobileFallback/SlotBlock), PR3 #108 operator surface (calendar tab in `/admin/slots` + `<SlotCancelModal>`), PR4 #109 teacher surface (`/teacher` full-week + cabinet 3-slot preview). Plan: `docs/plans/calendar-ui.md`. **Wave A leftovers (open):** PR3b — drag-paint + drag-move on operator calendar (deferred to keep PR3 momentum; ~4-6h). **Wave B (open, future):** learner-side calendar picker against `/api/slots/calendar` with the redacted DTO branches (`booked-other`, `past-redacted`). **Wave C (open, future):** teacher self-create (mutating endpoints + UI; needs design doc first per the existing rule).
- Phase 7 (when needed): refund / credit on cancellation; sunset `/pay` free-amount → tariff picker once the new flow is proven

Before starting any of these, write a fresh in-repo design doc. Code,
owner docs, and git history beat old chat outputs.

### Production reliability

- ~~wire up uptime / failure alerting on the app~~: **closed 2026-04-29**. GitHub Actions cron `*/5 *` pings `/api/health` and opens / closes an issue tagged `uptime-incident`. Runbook: `OPERATIONS.md §9`. Detection latency ~5–15 min (cron + GH Actions schedule jitter). For sub-minute precision, layer in BetterStack / Healthchecks.io.
- ~~add failure alerting on the **webhook contour** (CloudPayments check / pay / fail)~~: **shipped 2026-04-29 (workflow side; activation requires server-side patch)**. `scripts/webhook-flow-alert.mjs` plus systemd unit / timer (`scripts/systemd/`); every 30 minutes it reads `payment_audit_events` over the last hour and emails via Resend when `(paid + fail) / created < 0.3` with ≥5 created orders. Activation lives in the private operations runbook. Details: `OPERATIONS.md`.
- ~~signal failed git-based deploy or stuck `levelchannel-autodeploy.timer`~~: **shipped 2026-04-29 (workflow side; activation requires server-side patch)**. `.github/workflows/deploy-freshness.yml` compares `main` SHA with `version` from `/api/health` every 30 minutes; opens / closes a `deploy-stale` issue. Activation lives in the private operations runbook. Details: `OPERATIONS.md`.

### Security and payment safety

- ~~move the app-level rate limiter into a shared backend store for a multi-instance future~~: **closed 2026-05-04**. Migration 0016 added `rate_limit_buckets` (bucket_key PK, count, reset_at). `lib/security/rate-limit.ts` rewritten to a Postgres-backed atomic upsert with an in-memory fallback when `DATABASE_URL` is unset or transiently unreachable (warn-and-fall-through, nginx `limit_req` is the last line either way). `enforceRateLimit` is now async; the 21 call sites in `app/api/**` were updated. Cleanup folded into the existing daily systemd timer (`scripts/db-retention-cleanup.mjs`, rows with `reset_at < now() - 1h`). Covered by an in-memory unit suite plus a real-Postgres integration suite under `tests/integration/security/rate-limit.test.ts`.
- ~~add a separate audit log for critical payment transitions~~: **closed 2026-04-29**. Migration 0012 plus `lib/audit/payment-events.ts`; 10 final-state events written from 7 route handlers (`order.created` / `cancelled`, `mock.confirmed`, `webhook.pay.processed`, `webhook.fail.received`, `charge_token.succeeded` / `requires_3ds` / `declined`, `threeds.callback.received` / `confirmed` / `declined`). Best-effort recorder, retention 3 years, full PII under 152-FZ legitimate interest. Docs: `ARCHITECTURE.md` Audit log section, `SECURITY.md` Audit log section, `OPERATIONS.md §5` psql queries.
- ~~add pre-validation phases to audit~~: **closed 2026-04-29**. Migration 0014 plus `lib/payments/cloudpayments-route.ts` refactor; the wrapper now takes `kind: 'check'|'pay'|'fail'` and writes phase-0 (`webhook.<kind>.received`) after parse and phase-1 (`webhook.<kind>.declined` / `webhook.pay.validation_failed`) on validation failure. The old `webhook.fail.received` (semantically a finalize event) was renamed to `webhook.fail.processed`; live data was migrated in the same transaction.
- ~~add `charge_token.attempted`~~: **NOT planned**. `chargeWithSavedCard` creates `invoice_id` inside the function; an `attempted` event has no clean attach point (FK constraint to payment_orders). The outcome events (`succeeded` / `requires_3ds` / `declined`) cover the lifecycle.
- **`charge_token.error` (deferred)**: the sync-error path needs the `chargeWithSavedCard` return type to surface `invoice_id` even on throw. The route's catch currently sends `console.warn` to journald (see `app/api/payments/charge-token/route.ts`). Close it when a real incident with lost context shows up.
- ~~consolidate domain-specific Postgres pools into a shared `lib/db/pool.ts`~~: **closed 2026-04-29**. `lib/db/pool.ts`: `getDbPool()` (throws on missing `DATABASE_URL`) plus `getDbPoolOrNull()` (silent, for audit best-effort). All 5 domain getters (payments / auth / idempotency / telemetry / audit) delegate to the shared singleton; public API at call sites is unchanged. Connection footprint: 5×10=50 max before, `DATABASE_POOL_MAX` (default 10) now.
- ~~set up cron pruning for `payment_audit_events`~~: **shipped 2026-04-29 (workflow side; activation requires SSH)**. `scripts/db-retention-cleanup.mjs` plus systemd unit / timer (04:30 daily) deletes `payment_audit_events > 3 years` and expired rows from `account_sessions` / `email_verifications` / `password_resets` / `idempotency_records`. Activation details live in the private operations runbook.

## P1

### Payment domain

- ~~move from a polling-only model to a more reliable way to deliver the final status to the client~~: **shipped 2026-05-04**. SSE endpoint `/api/payments/[invoiceId]/stream` (`app/api/payments/[invoiceId]/stream/route.ts`) backed by an in-process `lib/payments/status-bus.ts` (Node `EventEmitter`). `markOrderPaid` / `markOrderFailed` / `markOrderCancelled` emit only on real transitions (the existing `payment.paid_duplicate` / `fail_duplicate` / `cancel_duplicate` event names short-circuit the emit). Browser `EventSource` in `components/payments/pricing-section.tsx` plus a slow 10-second poll as belt-and-suspenders fallback for ad-blockers / corporate proxies that strip `text/event-stream`. Heartbeat `:hb` every 25 s, hard cap 5 min per connection (EventSource auto-reconnects). `X-Accel-Buffering: no` so nginx flushes byte-by-byte. Multi-instance future: swap the bus for a PG `LISTEN/NOTIFY` wrapper without touching the route shape.
- ~~add lifecycle cleanup for old pending orders~~: **shipped 2026-05-04 (workflow side; activation requires server-side patch)**. `scripts/cancel-stale-orders.mjs` plus systemd unit / timer (`scripts/systemd/`); hourly at minute 7 it finds rows with `status='pending'` and `created_at < now() - <threshold>` (default 60 min, floor 30 min via `STALE_ORDER_THRESHOLD_MINUTES`), runs a per-row tx that flips status to `cancelled`, appends a `payment.cancelled` event with reason `stale_pending_timeout`, and writes a matching `order.cancelled` audit row with `actor='system'`. 4 integration tests cover stale cancel / fresh skip / terminal-status untouched / threshold-floor. Activation lives in the private operations runbook.
- ~~decide whether client-visible reconciliation or an operator-side payment list is needed~~: **operator list shipped 2026-05-04**. `/admin/payments` (paginated list with status/email filters) + `/admin/payments/[invoiceId]` (detail with order, payment_audit_events trail, payment_allocations + linked lesson_slots, internal events log). Driven by `lib/payments/admin-list.ts:listPaymentOrdersForAdmin`. Client-visible reconciliation deferred — the SSE push (`/api/payments/[invoiceId]/stream`) already covers learner-visible payment status; further reconciliation surfaces wait until a real workflow needs them.

### Observability

- ~~per-event operator notifications for payment failures~~: **shipped 2026-05-04**. `lib/email/templates/operator-payment-failure.ts` + `sendOperatorPaymentFailureNotification` in `lib/email/dispatch.ts`. Wired into the two terminal-failure surfaces: CloudPayments Fail webhook (`app/api/payments/webhooks/cloudpayments/fail/route.ts`) and 3DS callback decline (`app/api/payments/3ds-callback/route.ts`). Best-effort (try/catch around the dispatch call) so a Resend outage cannot block the webhook ack or the user redirect. Silent skip when `OPERATOR_NOTIFY_EMAIL` is empty. Validation failures and Check-phase declines are deliberately NOT notified (suspicious-but-not-terminal; covered by the audit log + the aggregate webhook-flow alert). Template covered by 5 unit tests.
- ~~hook up error tracking~~: **closed 2026-04-29**. Sentry @sentry/nextjs v10 plus `instrumentation.ts` (Node / Edge), `instrumentation-client.ts` (browser), `app/global-error.tsx`. Project: `mastery-zs/levelchannel`. End-to-end smoke event passed. Production activation lives in the private operations runbook.
- add operator signals for payment failures and webhook failures

### Auth and consent

- ~~add password hash versioning plus a `needsRehash()` path for future cost / algorithm changes~~: **closed 2026-04-29**. `passwordNeedsRehash()` in `lib/auth/password.ts` parses the cost from the bcrypt prefix; the login route silently re-hashes after `verifyPassword` and calls `setAccountPassword`. Best-effort (warn, continue on DB error). Covered by unit and integration tests. Future migration to argon2id: update the regex at the same time as introducing the new hasher, otherwise every login will rehash every time.
- ~~add cleanup for expired `account_sessions`~~: **shipped 2026-04-29**. Folded into `scripts/db-retention-cleanup.mjs` (above).
- ~~add common-password rejection~~: **closed 2026-04-29**. Local denylist in `lib/auth/common-passwords.ts` (~100 top breaches), normalizes case and whitespace; `validatePasswordPolicy` returns `too_common`. HIBP k-anonymity API stays as a future extension if needed.

### Cabinet Phase 6 deferments (parked here so they don't get forgotten)

- ~~wire `/pay` to the pricing catalog~~: **partially shipped 2026-05-04** as `/checkout/[tariffSlug]` running in parallel with `/pay`. The free-amount `/pay` stays untouched. Decision on whether to fold `/pay` into a tariff picker (or keep both indefinitely) deferred until the new flow has soak time.
- **collect `phone_e164` on the profile** if and when an operator workflow actually needs to call or Telegram a learner. Until then we don't widen the PD surface.

## P2

### Product and operator tooling

- add a proper operator-side payment list instead of manual DB / file inspection
- add payment funnel telemetry useful for decisions
- ~~add operator email notification for a successful payment~~: **closed 2026-04-29**. Inline in the pay-webhook handler after `markOrderPaid` plus audit. Renders via `lib/email/templates/operator-payment-notify.ts`, dispatched via `sendOperatorPaymentNotification()`. Best-effort (try / catch plus warn). Production activation lives in the private operations runbook. Silent no-op when unset.
- Telegram notification: separate wave if email turns out to be insufficient (needs bot token plus parse_mode reasoning; do it when a real need appears).
- ~~add `POST /api/auth/resend-verify` plus UI button~~: **closed 2026-04-29**. Endpoint in `app/api/auth/resend-verify/route.ts` (authenticated, idempotent, rate-limited 10/min/IP plus 3/hour/account); UI button in `app/cabinet/resend-verify-button.tsx` replaced the Phase 2 hack of linking to `/forgot`.
- ~~add a consent withdrawal model for `account_consents`~~: **closed 2026-04-29**. Migration 0013 added a `revoked_at` column plus partial index `account_consents_active_idx` (where `revoked_at IS NULL`). Store ops in `lib/auth/consents.ts`: `withdrawConsent()` (stamps the latest unrevoked row), `getActiveConsent()` (returns the latest non-revoked). UI / API endpoint goes with Phase 3 admin / cabinet. Covered by 5 integration tests. Implements 152-FZ art.9 §5.
- add a separate `accepted_at`-covering index for `account_consents` if consent-history becomes a real hot path

### DX and quality

- ~~assemble a security regression checklist for releases~~: **closed 2026-04-29**. `docs/security-regression-checklist.md`: 9 sections (code-review gates, tests must be green, auth invariants matrix cross-ref, payment + webhook invariants, audit log invariants, observability, legal scope, post-merge smoke, quarterly drill). First scheduled drill: 2026-07-29.
- ~~widen integration coverage for payment routes~~: **closed 2026-04-29**. `tests/integration/payment/payment-routes.test.ts` covers `POST /api/payments` (create plus amount / consent rejection plus idempotency replay), cancel (success plus 404 plus 400 malformed id), mock-confirm. Each test asserts DB state plus audit event shape. All against a real Docker Postgres in mock-payment mode (via `TEST_INTEGRATION=1`, which makes setup-env switch provider / storage / allowMockConfirm). Webhook handlers: in the next item.
- ~~add an integration test for webhook handlers (HMAC verify path)~~: **closed 2026-04-29**. `tests/integration/payment/webhooks.test.ts` plus helper `tests/integration/payment/sign.ts`. 4 tests: Pay valid → paid plus received / processed audit; HMAC mismatch → 401, no audit; Pay amount-mismatch → received plus validation_failed; Fail valid → failed plus received / processed audit. Order seeding goes through a direct INSERT (not through `createPayment`) because in integration mode the provider is mock and webhook validation requires `provider='cloudpayments'`.
- ~~parameterize the Docker integration stack for parallel CI~~: **closed 2026-04-29**. `docker-compose.test.yml` now reads `LC_TEST_DB_NAMESPACE` (default `default`) and `LC_TEST_DB_PORT` (default 54329) from env. `scripts/test-integration.sh` derives namespace plus port from `LC_TEST_PARALLEL_ID` (sha256 → 8-char suffix plus port window 54330..54429), plus a unique `COMPOSE_PROJECT_NAME`. Single-developer flow stays byte-equal historical defaults; parallel shards / runners no longer fight over the port / container.
- ~~add an integration test for login with an unverified email (Phase 1B D4)~~: **closed 2026-04-29**. `tests/integration/auth/login.test.ts` now contains the test `allows login when email is not yet verified`: registers, asserts `emailVerifiedAt` is null, login returns 200 plus session cookie plus body with `emailVerifiedAt: null`.
- add a real-time signal for `/verify-pending`, only if users actually need it

## Not now

- do not bloat the cabinet beyond auth and payment-adjacent scenarios without a direct business need
- do not collect more personal data at checkout
- do not complicate the payment form without a direct business need

## P3 — security maturity (revisit when scale or fundraise demands)

Captured 2026-05-09 after the two-day security sprint (Waves 5/8/9/10/11 + Issues #86/#88) closed everything that was technically actionable. The items below are **structural / process** gaps. They don't represent vulnerabilities — they represent missing layers that a bigger company / a regulated audit / a Stripe-grade due-diligence would expect. Investing in them on the current QPS (~10 page views / hour, ~50 payments / month) is overkill; they belong in P3 until scale or a fundraise demands them.

### Staging environment
**Trigger:** the next time we hit a prod-only failure (we had 2 on 2026-05-08). **Cost:** ~$5/mo for a second small VPS + automation to mirror migrations. **Value:** every "deploy then discover it doesn't work on this kernel/Node/systemd combo" cycle becomes a non-event. Today we mitigate via fast rollback + post-deploy smoke; staging eliminates the rollback window entirely.

### Cloudflare (or equivalent) in front
**Trigger:** first sustained traffic spike that the single nginx layer can't absorb, OR first DDoS attempt. **Cost:** $0 (free tier) - $20/mo (Pro). **Value:** L4/L7 DDoS protection, edge caching, country-blocking, WAF rules. Trade-off: another vendor in the data path, CSP `connect-src` may need tuning.

### Backup-restore drill
**Trigger:** quarterly. **Cost:** 2-3 hours each time. **Value:** confirms the backups in the private runbook are actually restorable end-to-end. Today: backups exist, but "can we restore them" is untested. Add a calendared item ("first Friday of each quarter") + checklist in the private operations runbook.

### Formal threat model
**Trigger:** before next material code-architecture change OR before a regulatory audit / fundraise DD. **Cost:** 1-2 day exercise (STRIDE per surface, attack-tree per asset). **Value:** moves SECURITY.md from "list of controls we have" to "controls we have mapped to specific attacker goals" — exposes blind spots that ad-hoc reviews miss. Output: `docs/security-threat-model.md`.

### External pen-test
**Trigger:** before a fundraise where due-diligence will demand it, OR after a material expansion of the attack surface (new payment flow, new auth method, public API). **Cost:** $3K-$8K from a Russian-market pen-test vendor. **Value:** independent third party tries to break things; produces a report we can hand to investors / regulators. Codex + self-review are good but not equivalent.

### `security.txt` + responsible-disclosure policy
**Trigger:** as soon as anyone external (researcher, customer) asks "where do I report a vulnerability." **Cost:** ~30 min of writing + DNS/file. **Value:** formal channel that doesn't end up in support@. Spec: https://securitytxt.org. Place at `/.well-known/security.txt`. Should also document scope, expected response time, what's in/out (e.g. social-engineering excluded).

### SBOM + supply-chain provenance
**Trigger:** SOC 2 / regulatory audit, OR after a notable npm-supply-chain incident. **Cost:** 1-2 days of tooling integration (`syft` for SBOM, `cosign` for signed builds, npm provenance flag). **Value:** a real answer to "what's in your build, can you prove it." Today: `package-lock.json` + `npm audit`. That's a baseline, not a chain of custody.

### HA / multi-instance / failover
**Trigger:** sustained traffic that justifies horizontal scaling, OR business-continuity SLA commitment. **Cost:** order-of-magnitude infra cost (load balancer, second app server, PG read replica or failover, shared session store, multi-instance rate-limit), plus rewriting `lib/security/rate-limit.ts` in-memory fallback path (currently OK because there IS no second instance — but multi-instance + memory fallback = bypassable per-IP cap, called out in Wave 7 #4). **Value:** the prod VPS can fail / be reimaged / be redeployed without user-visible downtime.

### Other deferred items (cross-reference)

- **Wave 6 #4 Phase 3** — calendar trigger ≈2026-05-15: drop the 24h legacy grace window in `evaluateReceiptGate`. One-line code change once the soak window passes.
- **Wave 10 #1 finishing touch** — when РКН confirms registration, paste the registry number + filing date into `app/privacy/page.tsx` §1 (3-line attributive PR).
- **Wave 10 #2b** — physical PO box / virtual office for the IP claims address (currently the IP's residential address from EGRIP is used). Privacy upside; not a regulatory blocker.
- **GA wiring decision** — Open Question #1 from Wave 11 plan (deferred 2026-05-08): drop GA/GTM allowlist entries from CSP, OR actually wire GA. Current: dead allowlist entries kept "just in case."
